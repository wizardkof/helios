//! # Where `unsafe` sits on these declarations (R814)
//!
//! Rust's one memory-safety signal used to be attached to the wrong six
//! declarations here, so a reviewer scanning for `unsafe` call sites looked in
//! the wrong places. Three pointer-laundering entry points were SAFE
//! (`set_resource_kmt_handles`, `transfer_resource_ownership`,
//! `open_ddi_texture2d`) while three that take only scalars and cannot violate
//! memory safety were `unsafe fn` (`present_frame_gate`, and
//! `present_sync_fence_id` / `present_flip_wait_arm`, both retired with the
//! kwait subsystem in T6/R912a).
//!
//! Scope limit worth stating, because it changes the finding's shape: cxx
//! REQUIRES `unsafe fn` for any signature containing a raw pointer, and every
//! raw-pointer declaration in this block already is. Those are correct and are
//! not touched. `present_vehicle_copy` takes `usize` COM pointers AND is
//! already unsafe, which is the correct end state; it is left alone too
//! (`present_sync_publish` was its twin until R912a retired it).

//! cxx bridge to DXVK's C++ engine.
//!
//! The UMD's `d3d10umddi` frontend (Rust) calls into DXVK's `DxvkInstance`/
//! `DxvkAdapter`/`DxvkDevice` through this bridge. The C++ side (`bridge/
//! dxvk_bridge.cpp`) owns the DXVK `Rc<>` objects inside an opaque
//! `HeliosDxvkDevice`; Rust holds it via `UniquePtr`.
//!
//! Backend Vulkan device = the Gate-5a venus ICD; the shim force-selects it via
//! `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME="Virtio-GPU Venus"` before creating the instance.

//
// After R813 the safe wrappers exist, but the raw `usize`-returning methods
// remain callable at every site, so nothing prevents a future caller choosing
// the wrong adoption. Module privacy alone is NOT sufficient: cxx generates the
// raw methods as INHERENT methods on the public opaque type, and inherent
// methods of a re-exported public type stay callable regardless of module
// visibility. A newtype with no `Deref` is the only encoding that actually
// seals them -- which is why `BridgeDevice` deliberately has none, and why
// `inner` is private.
//
// The C++ side still returns `usize`, so the ABI is unchanged and this
// migration cannot break the wire.

/// A **source** resource pointer for the present path.
///
/// `present_vehicle_copy(dst, src)` took the same two COM pointers in the
/// OPPOSITE order to the neighbouring `present_sync_publish(src, dst)` (retired
/// in R912a), they were called ~30 lines apart in the same function, and a
/// transposition compiled cleanly on both sides of the FFI. Transposing
/// `present_vehicle_copy` is ALWAYS harmful -- the bridge copies the vehicle
/// backbuffer INTO the imported ICD frame, the geometry check passes because
/// both are the same size, `EXT_GEOM_MISMATCH` never fires, and the flipped
/// backbuffer shows whatever it held last frame. That is exactly the
/// stale-frame symptom class this project has already spent multiple sessions
