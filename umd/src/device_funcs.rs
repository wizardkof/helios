//! D3D11 device object + device-funcs table fill (Gate 5b, Milestone 1).
//!
//! The OS D3D11 runtime drives `D3D11CreateDevice` into our adapter `CreateDevice`
//! DDI, which must hand back a fully-populated `D3D11DDI_DEVICEFUNCS` table (152
//! entries) and return S_OK. A null entry the runtime calls = crash, so we fill
//! **all** entries with a safe stub and specialise the few whose return value
//! matters. This is the minimal honest device that lets the runtime accept the
//! device (Milestone 1 = D3D11CreateDevice S_OK → DWM stops fail-fasting); real
//! rendering DDIs come later, backed by the DXVK device this object holds.
//!
//! Every callback uses the WDK's APIENTRY ABI (`extern "system"`), including
//! fallback handlers. Typed table literals preserve x86 callee stack cleanup
//! and the exact return shape instead of transmuting one universal function.
