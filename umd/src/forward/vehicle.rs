//! The dcomp-vehicle present producer.
//!
//! The in-process hand-off the Mesa ICD's WSI uses: `set_present_source` parks
//! one frame's venus identity in a thread-local, the next `dxgi_present` on
//! THAT THREAD consumes it, and `wait_last_present` is the ICD's recycle gate.
//!
//! Moved verbatim out of `forward.rs` by T8/R1108. The three TLS cells are
//! declared HERE and are private to this module, so "only the vehicle entry
//! point may consume `PRESENT_SOURCE`" is module privacy rather than a comment,
//! and the same-thread contract has exactly one place to be stated.
//!
//! ⚠ NOT here, deliberately: the bounded frame gate (`run_present_frame_gate`,
//! `GateOutcome`, `PRESENT_GATE_*` and `EXT_FLIP_GATE_TIMEOUTS`). It is the
//! frozen baseline's frame-completion contract, it runs on EVERY present and
//! not only on vehicle presents, and its position relative to the flush is the
//! one thing this item must not move.
