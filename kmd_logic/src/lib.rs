//! helios_kmd_logic — host-testable leaf logic for the Helios WDDM miniport.
//!
//! `kmd_render` cannot host a libtest harness at all: `kmd_render/build.rs` runs
//! bindgen over `ntddk.h` / `dispmprt.h` / `d3dkmddi.h` and shells out to
//! `rc.exe`, and the crate is a `panic = "abort"` `cdylib`. So any KMD logic that
//! deserves an automated oracle has to be moved *out* of the crate rather than
//! tested in place. This crate is where it goes.
//!
//! The contract that makes that worth doing is the absent dependency edge: there
//! is no `wdk-sys`, no `wdk-build`, no `bytemuck`, and no generated `dxgk`
//! binding reachable from here, so nothing in this crate can read a `DXGKARG_*`
//! field, a `HANDLE`, or an atomic out of `AdapterContext`. Every rule below is
//! a function of its arguments and nothing else, which is exactly the property
//! that makes it testable on the host.
//!
//! Run the tests with `cargo test` inside `kmd_logic/`, the same way `protocol/`
//! is tested. Nothing else runs them.

// ── Venus VkImageCreateInfo / VkMemoryAllocateInfo encoding ───────────────────
//
// R1002. Several image and memory encoders each re-emitted the whole
// struct body inline — about 25 `Writer` calls for an image — differing only in
// the pNext chain and a handful of scalars. Two of the three image bodies wrote
// `w.u32(0); // VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL` as a BARE LITERAL while the third used
// the named `IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR`: the exact shape of the 39th-session defect (a
// tiling scalar hand-written in one of several copies of one struct), only
// inverted. That session's root cause was `IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR` being defined as
// 0, i.e. OPTIMAL, and it painted black.
//
// The pNext encoding is order-sensitive in a way no reader can infer from a call
// site: for the export-plus-dedicated allocation, the DEDICATED struct's fields
// are written inline first and the EXPORT struct's own `handleTypes` field comes
// AFTER them, because export's pNext points at dedicated. Getting that backwards
// produces a stream the host decodes as a different allocation.
//
// These live in `kmd_logic`, not in `venus.rs`, for one reason: they can then be
// pinned by golden-byte tests on the Linux host. The literals in those tests were
// produced by compiling the PRE-CHANGE inline sequences and printing their
// output, so they are an equivalence proof against the old code rather than a
// restatement of the new.

/// Scan-out presentation-epoch ownership — the display-consumer half of
/// "when may Windows have this allocation back?" (ROADMAP defect 0ab-B).
///
/// # The invariant
///
/// A Helios scan-out is **not** a continuous scan-out. The host reads the bound
/// DMA-BUF exactly once per `RESOURCE_FLUSH` and at no other time, so a
/// presented buffer must be immutable from the moment it is published to the
/// host until that read has finished. Windows knows nothing about that read: it
/// retires a flip on the driver's own completion notifications and then hands
/// the buffer back to DXGI, which hands it to the app, which clears it to
/// opaque black for its next frame — while the host has still not read it. That
/// is the entirely-black published frame.
///
/// So a presentation may be released only when BOTH halves hold:
///
/// ```text
/// reuse_safe(epoch) = producer_venus_work_retired(epoch)
///                     AND host_reader_lease_ended(epoch)
/// ```
///
/// The producer half already exists (`VirtioGpu::note_wddm_submission`'s wire-
/// fence watermark). This module is the second half.
///
/// # The state machine
///
/// * Every presentation of a buffer to the host mints a **monotonically
///   increasing epoch**. Re-presenting a still-bound buffer mints a NEW epoch:
///   the app wrote it again, so it needs to be read again. A bind generation
///   would collapse those and is therefore not enough.
/// * `bound_epoch` is the epoch whose buffer the host is bound to right now. It
///   advances only when the display worker has actually published the binding
///   (a completed `SET_SCANOUT_BLOB`, or an already-bound re-present).
/// * A `RESOURCE_FLUSH` issued while `bound_epoch == E` proves, when its
///   response returns, that the host has read the buffer of epoch `E` — and, by
///   monotonicity, of every epoch below it. That is [`LeaseTracker::issue_flush`]
///   / [`LeaseTracker::complete_flush`], and the snapshot `E` is the typed token
///   the transport carries on the in-flight entry.
/// * `read_epoch` is the watermark: every epoch `<= read_epoch` has ended its
///   lease. It only ever moves forward ([`merge_read_epoch`]), so a completion
///   that arrives out of order is inert rather than corrupting.
/// * A successful bind of a DIFFERENT resource ends every older epoch's lease
///   without a read. The virtio control queue is strictly FIFO host-side, so a
///   returned `SET_SCANOUT_BLOB` proves every earlier-enqueued flush already
///   completed, and a flush enqueued later cannot read a resource that is no
///   longer the scan-out. **A completed bind is not a completed read** — it is a
///   proof that no read remains, which is a different (and weaker) statement,
///   and it is why this is the escape hatch and not the primary terminator.
/// * Failure, cancellation and teardown end leases explicitly and loudly. There
///   is deliberately NO timeout: a lease is never released on the theory that
///   the read has probably finished by now.
///
/// # Why the shipped driver mirrors this with atomics
///
/// The three edges run under three different locks: the mint is on the
/// `DxgkDdiSubmitCommand` DISPATCH path, the bind and the flush issue are on the
/// PASSIVE display worker under `scanout_mutex`, and the flush completion is in
/// the used-ring drain under `virtio_lock` — which may not take
/// `wddm_notify_lock`, because the established order is the reverse and
/// inverting it is a DIRQL deadlock. Every transition here is monotone, so the
/// KMD implements them as `fetch_add` / `fetch_max` on `AdapterContext` atomics
/// and calls the SAME predicates below.
///
/// # ⚠ WHAT 22.22.217.0 RETIRED, and what it kept
///
/// The **withholding** half above — holding `DXGK_INTERRUPT_DMA_COMPLETED` and
/// the CRTC_VSYNC primary address until the presentation's read finished — was
/// built, shipped and MEASURED INERT against the defect: a 2×2 lease ×
/// `BindFlushMode` factorial over 46 681 frames moved whole-flush black by
/// nothing in any cell (14.5–16.6 % everywhere). The reason is structural and is
/// now proven: the app's clear of a reclaimed buffer never travels in a WDDM DMA
/// buffer, so no completion-notification policy can order it. The driver
/// therefore gates a WDDM submission on its Venus watermark alone again.
///
/// The **epochs** are kept and are load-bearing for the replacement fix: the
/// ownership gate on the flush executor ([`surplus_republish`]), which refuses to
/// re-read a binding generation that has already been published while a newer
/// presentation is outstanding. So [`next_epoch`], [`merge_read_epoch`] and
/// [`lease_satisfied`] are shipped predicates; [`LeaseTracker`]'s FIFO/pending-
/// primary machinery below is the specification of the RETIRED withholding, kept
/// as the record of what was measured — it is no longer a model of shipped code.
