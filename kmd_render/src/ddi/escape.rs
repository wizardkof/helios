//! `DxgkDdiEscape` — out-of-band ICD → KMD channel (Phase 3, M3.3 → C3/M3.4).
//!
//! The user-mode Vulkan ICD reaches the KMD through `D3DKMTEscape`, not through
//! the WDDM command/GPU-VA path. Every escape buffer begins with a
//! [`HeliosEscapeHeader`] (`helios_protocol::escape`); we validate it and
//! dispatch the Venus control verbs.
//!
//! C3/M3.4: SUBMIT_VENUS is ASYNC — it queues the stream, writes the assigned
//! wire fence id back into the escape buffer, and returns; WAIT_FENCE is a
//! real PASSIVE KEVENT wait on that wire id. All other verbs are synchronous
//! flows through `virtio::ctrl` (PASSIVE waits — never a DISPATCH spin under
//! the device spinlock).
//!
//! TRUST BOUNDARY: `pPrivateDriverData` is guest-supplied. We treat
//! `PrivateDriverDataSize` as the only authoritative length and bounds-check
//! every struct size and embedded offset against it before reading, and we read
//! with `pod_read_unaligned` because the buffer carries no alignment guarantee.

///
///   * `buf[16..24]` / `buf[24..32]` re-encoded `HeliosEscapeWaitFence`'s layout
///     as literal offsets. Insert a field before `timeout_ns`, or reorder the C
///     copy, and the size asserts still pass while the KMD waits on a garbage
///     timeout with no diagnostic.
///   * `legacy = buf.len() < sz` and `v2 = buf.len() >= sz2` made the runtime's
///     BUFFER LENGTH the protocol version rather than the caller's declared
///     struct size, so any caller whose scratch buffer happened to be large
///     enough was served a newer layout than it declared.
///   * `hdr.size`, validated once in the dispatcher, was then never consulted by
///     any arm — the only per-message declared length was dead.
///
/// `EscapeBuf` makes the struct definition the only layout authority: an arm
/// touches the guest buffer through `read`/`write_back` or not at all, and both
/// bounds — what the caller DECLARED (`hdr.size`) and what the runtime actually
/// supplied (`buf.len()`) — are checked once, at construction.

///
/// `SUBMIT_VENUS` sets `hdr.size = sizeof(struct helios_escape_submit_venus)` =
