//! PASSIVE-level control-command orchestration (C3/M3.4).
//!
//! Every virtio-gpu control verb (ctx/blob/map/attach/unref) is a multi-phase
//! flow here: table phase(s) under the device spinlock ([`VirtioGpu`] helpers)
//! interleaved with a host round-trip whose WAIT happens at PASSIVE_LEVEL on a
//! stack [`SyncWaitBlock`] KEVENT — never a DISPATCH spin under the spinlock.
//! The waits use adaptive slices and re-drain the used ring on each slice, so
//! they are interrupt-driven when interrupts flow and degrade to ~ms-latency
//! polling when they do not (bring-up, lost interrupts).
//!
//! Why this exists (2026-07-04 evidence): the host processes the virtio ctrl
//! queue serially, and a venus `RESOURCE_CREATE_BLOB(blob_id)` can legally
//! block host-side waiting for the vkr ring to execute the referenced
//! `vkAllocateMemory` — so ANY control command can take seconds under a
//! validate-slow host. The old model burned a ~1 s DISPATCH spin per waiter
//! under the device spinlock and then poisoned the transport; this model waits
//! properly and, on timeout, abandons only its own in-flight slot.
//!
//! # IRQL
//!
//! Every function in this module runs at PASSIVE_LEVEL, and since R614 that is a
//! signature rather than this comment: every entry point takes a
//! [`crate::irql::PassiveLevel`], which safe code cannot construct. What the
//! token proves, exactly:
//!
//! * **What it does prove.** A caller that holds no token cannot reach any of
//!   these functions at all. The concrete case: the DIRQL half of
//!   `DxgkDdiSetVidPnSourceAddress` (`ddi::display`) holds no token, so
//!   `set_scanout_blob` and `resource_flush` are unreachable from it, and adding
//!   such a call is a compile error instead of a shipped DISPATCH deadlock.
//! * **What it does NOT prove.** The live IRQL. Only `KeGetCurrentIrql` can, and
//!   this module deliberately does not call it per entry point — one check inside
//!   `PassiveLevel::assume` at the DDI boundary is the whole budget. So the
//!   guarantee is about *provenance*: every token in the driver traces to one of
//!   twelve audited mints (`grep -rn 'PassiveLevel::assume()' src/`), four of
//!   which sit below a runtime IRQL gate that already existed, plus one
//!   structural claim about the venus gateway
//!   (`AdapterContext::with_venus_client`).
//!
//! `crate::irql::IRQL_ASSUME_BAD` — the `IrqlBad` breadcrumb — is what turns a
//! wrong audit into evidence. It must read 0.
//!
//! One PASSIVE-only operation is still outside the type system:
//! `DmaBuffer`'s `Drop` (`MmFreeContiguousMemory`). `Drop::drop` has a fixed
//! signature, so the transport parks completed buffers and frees them from
//! [`reap_parked`] instead of letting the DISPATCH drain drop one.
//!
//! ONE function here is deliberately IRQL-free and takes no token:
//! [`fill_set_scanout_blob`], which only writes the fields of a wire command
//! someone else owns. It lives here so the DISPATCH-level fast bind
//! (`VirtioGpu::enqueue_scanout_bind_async`, ROADMAP defect 0ab-C) and the
//! PASSIVE round-trip below cannot encode the same command differently.
