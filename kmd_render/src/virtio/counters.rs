//
// WHY THESE EXIST. UV3 — "does vkd3d's venus work retire at host GPU completion
// or at decode?" — was documented as pre-checkable with zero code by reading
// [`RING_SUBMIT_COUNT`] before and after a run. It is not: that counter is
// adapter-wide and dominated by this driver's own scanout/BLT copies (above),
// and until this commit it was READ in exactly one place — words 33/34 of the
// `'HDBG'` report `DxgkDdiCollectDbgInfo` emits, which dxgkrnl calls only on a
// TDR. Reading it required provoking the failure it was supposed to predict.
//
// These two count only submissions that arrived through the guest's
// `HELIOS_ESCAPE_SUBMIT_VENUS`, attributed at `submit_venus_async_inner`
// (`virtio/ctrl.rs`), which is reachable from nowhere else (`ddi/escape.rs:1233`
// and `:1242` are its only callers).
//
// ⛔⛔ HOW TO READ THEM: **ONLY AS DELTAS AGAINST A CONTROL ARM. THE ZERO FORMS
// ARE UNSATISFIABLE READINGS AND ANY RULE PHRASED ON ONE IS UNFALSIFIABLE.**
//
// WHOSE ACTIVITY INCREMENTS THEM. Every client of this adapter's, DWM's
// included. "Guest-attributed" means attributed to the guest SIDE of the wire —
// `submit_venus_async_inner` counts each `HELIOS_ESCAPE_SUBMIT_VENUS` from
// whichever process made it — NOT attributed to a process. They are plain
// statics in the driver image with no reset at StartDevice, so a value is
// cumulative over every device generation since the image loaded, and
// `pnputil /restart-device` does not zero it.
//
// ⛔ AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS COMMENT SAID *"the informative reading is a
// ZERO"* AND GAVE `EscSub > 0 && EscSubRing == 0` AND `EscSub == 0` AS DECISION
// RULES. Neither branch can ever be taken on a live desktop, so their absence
// would have been read as evidence for the other branch. The mechanism that
// forecloses them is the SHIPPING D3D11 PRESENT PATH:
// `vn_signal_win32_external_semaphore` (`icd/mesa/src/virtio/vulkan/vn_queue.c`)
// builds a `vn_renderer_submit_batch` with `ring_idx =
// sem->external_payload.ring_idx`, which `vn_queue_submission_prepare` sets to
// the submitting `VkQueue`'s own `ring_idx`; every `VkQueue` acquires
// its ring through `vn_instance_acquire_ring_idx` (`vn_device.c`), and ring 0 is
// RESERVED for the CPU timeline (`vn_instance.c` seeds `ring_idx_used_mask` with
// bit 0), so that value is always >= 1. When the payload carries a ring seqno
// the batch also carries `cs_size != 0`, and `helios_submit`
// (`vn_renderer_helios.c`) turns exactly such a batch into ONE
// `HELIOS_ESCAPE_SUBMIT_VENUS`. ⇒ each DWM present through a shared/win32
// semaphore adds ~1 to `EscSub` AND ~1 to `EscSubRing`, with no D3D12 client on
// the box at all.
//
// ⭐ THE PROCEDURE THAT DOES WORK — an idle-desktop delta and a probe delta over
// the SAME wall-clock window, subtracted:
//   * `Δ EscSubRing` GROWS when a D3D12 workload is added ⇒ vkd3d's work does
//     reach a GPU-completion ring. This is the reading that would refute
//     "vkd3d's work is ring-0 only", and it is the whole reason these exist.
//   * `Δ EscSubRing` UNCHANGED while `Δ EscSub` grows ⇒ the D3D12 client submits
//     through this transport but never on a GPU-completion ring.
//     `RetireDomain::IncludingGpu` (implemented as "no in-flight entry below the
//     watermark, whatever its ring") is then gating on host DECODE, not GPU
//     completion, and a D3D12 fence built on it would report decode and lie.
//   * NEITHER delta grows ⇒ this driver saw nothing new from that process. That
//     is the shape that fits a 0.8–1.1 µs fence wait: a plain `vkQueueSubmit`'s
//     command stream never touches virtio (it rides the shared ring), and the
//     only virtio submit a frame can produce by itself is the
//     `vkNotifyRingMESA` doorbell — hardcoded `ring_idx = 0` (`/* CPU ring */`
//     in `vn_renderer_util.h`'s `vn_renderer_submit_simple`) and emitted only when
//     the host ring advertises IDLE and the `VN_RING_IDLE_TIMEOUT_NS` limiter has
//     expired (`vn_ring.c`). A ring busier than 1 ms emits no doorbell and
//     therefore no wire fence at all.
//   * `Δ RngSub` climbing while `Δ EscSubRing` stays put ⇒ all NEW ring-1 work is
//     this driver's own compositor copies. That is the state the old single
//     counter could not distinguish from success.
//
// ⚠ The control arm is not optional and it is not arithmetic: there is no
// constant to subtract, because DWM's per-present contribution scales with how
// much the desktop composited during the window. Two windows of equal wall-clock
// length with the desktop otherwise untouched is the whole method.
//
// ⚠ [`ASYNC_SUBMIT_COUNT`] is NOT the guest total and cannot stand in for
// `EscSub`: it is bumped inside `enqueue_submit_inner`, so it already includes
// all four entry points, scanout and BLT copies among them. It is mirrored
// separately as `AsSub`.

/// Fenced SUBMIT_3D enqueues accepted from a guest `HELIOS_ESCAPE_SUBMIT_VENUS`,

/// the generation test runs inside `wddm_boundary::select` before the `d3d12` bit
/// is looked at. A survivor of a device restart is far more likely to be DWM (it
/// is the longest-lived D3D client on the box and it is not restarted by
/// `pnputil /restart-device`) than a freshly launched D3D12 probe.
///
/// ⛔⛔ GRADING, CORRECTED — **"0 on any session without a device restart" IS NOT
/// EVALUABLE FROM THIS COUNTER.** It is a plain image-lifetime static with NO
/// reset at StartDevice, and the standard deploy IS `pnputil /restart-device`. So
/// after the first restart in a boot the value is permanently nonzero and stays

/// restart of its own. The counter cannot tell you which generation its
/// increments came from.
///
/// ⇒ The evaluable forms:
///   * a DELTA across a window with NO device restart in it — must be 0. Nonzero
///     there means some client is sampling fence ids that did not come from this
///     transport, which is the different and worse finding;
///   * a DELTA across a window that DID contain a restart — a small number is the
///     surviving-client case the striding comment at `VirtioGpu::init` describes,
///     and it is expected;
///   * the absolute value — says only "at least one restart has happened since
///     this driver image loaded", which the boot log already says better.

// marker it accepted before these existed; both are pure observation, mirrored

//
// WHY THEY EXIST. `KMD_IMPACT.md` §14a.2 K-F2 asked for the tag path's own
// comparison — refuse unless `value <= slot.submitted_value` — as a guard
// against a guest naming a boundary that can never be satisfied. That guard is
// REFUTED, and these two counters are what makes the refutation measurable
// instead of argued: on the shipping default the marker is delivered BEFORE the
// frame's `vkQueueSubmit`, deliberately. `UmdAsyncPresentStream` is absent = ON
// (`umd/src/knobs.rs:129`), and the eligible arm then SKIPS
// `HeliosWaitFrameSubmitted` (`umd/src/forward/present.rs:1479-1528`) precisely
// because the marker is what carries the dependency; the value is minted on the
// app thread (`umd/bridge/dxvk_bridge.cpp:1316`) while the tag that advances
// `submitted_value` rides DXVK's submission thread
// (`d3d11_context_imm.cpp:1150-1162` is `EmitCs` only → `vn_queue.c:1994` →
// `:1736-1744`).
//
// ⇒ a NONZERO count is the EXPECTED steady state, and `PsMkAhdHi` should sit at
// or near 1. That is the opposite grading from every other counter in this
// block.
//
// ⭐ THE READING THAT WOULD REFUTE THE REFUTATION: `PsMkAhdHi == 0` across a
// desktop + Fire Strike run means no marker ever ran ahead — the tag reliably
// beats the marker — and the acceptance-side guard K-F2 asked for was viable
// after all. That inversion is the entire reason these are worth a deploy.
//
// ⚠ Registry values persist across boots (AGENTS.md rule 6): verify both MOVE
