//! The virtio-gpu device object, built on the `virtio-drivers` PCI transport.
//!
//! `VirtioGpu` owns the `PciTransport` (discovers/maps the virtio config
//! regions) and the control `VirtQueue`, and layers the virtio-gpu command
//! protocol (`helios_protocol`) on top. Built by `init` from
//! `DxgkDdiStartDevice` and stored in `AdapterContext::virtio`.
//!
//! Bring-up (all in `init`, at PASSIVE_LEVEL):
//!   M1 — `DxgkConfigAccess` → `PciRoot` → `PciTransport::new::<WdkHal,_>`
//!   M2 — feature negotiation via the `Transport` trait
//!   M3 — control `VirtQueue::<WdkHal>` setup + DRIVER_OK
//!   M4 — `GET_DISPLAY_INFO` polled round-trip (Phase-2 smoke test)
//!
//! ## C3/M3.4 async transport (2026-07-04)
//!
//! Every control-queue command is a tracked [`InFlight`] entry that OWNS its
//! device-visible DMA buffers until the device returns its descriptor chain on
//! the used ring ([`VirtioGpu::drain_used`], token-matched `peek_used` →
//! `pop_used` — ported from the proven System-class phase4e model in
//! `kmd/src/virtio/gpu.rs`). Nothing in this module ever waits:
//!
//!   * Fenced `SUBMIT_3D` is ASYNC ([`VirtioGpu::enqueue_async_submit`]): the
//!     KMD assigns a globally-monotonic WIRE fence id, queues the descriptors,
//!     notifies, and returns. Completion signals any registered
//!     [`FenceWaiter`] (KEVENT) and advances the WDDM pending FIFO.
//!   * Synchronous verbs (ctx/blob/map) are enqueued with an optional
//!     [`SyncWaitBlock`] waiter ([`VirtioGpu::enqueue_sync`]); the waiter
//!     blocks at PASSIVE_LEVEL in `virtio::ctrl`, NEVER at DISPATCH under the
//!     device spinlock (the 2026-07-04 Escape-convoy root cause).
//!   * Completed entries are parked (their `DmaBuffer`s are PASSIVE-only to
//!     free) and reaped by PASSIVE callers via [`VirtioGpu::begin_parked_reap`].
//!
//! The used-ring consumer is [`VirtioGpu::drain_used`], called from the
//! interrupt DPC (`ddi/interrupt.rs`) and opportunistically (under the same
//! spinlock) by enqueue paths and by `virtio::ctrl`'s wait slices, so waits
//! survive a lost interrupt with only slice-granularity latency.

/// GpuFncGen`, with *"any shortfall means a D3D12 packet took a prefix arm, which
/// is the defect A4 names coming back"*. That arithmetic cannot hold, so its
/// failure would have been reported as a closed defect re-opening. Four
/// independent reasons, each sufficient:
///
///  1. **THE UNITS DIFFER.** `D12Rec`/`D12Zero`/`D12MrgF`/`D12Merged`/`D12Clr`
///     count `DxgkDdiRender` calls — one per ECL record decoded. THIS counts
///     `DxgkDdiSubmitCommand{,Virtual}` packets. dxgkrnl batches Renders into one
///     DMA buffer, so N records can produce one submission.
///  2. **`D12Merged` IS NOT IN THE EXPRESSION** and is exactly the collapse in
///     (1): the k-1 later records in a batch merge into the first (largest fence
///     wins), contributing 0 further exact submissions.
///  3. **REPLAYS ARE UNACCOUNTED.** `PresentSubmissionPrivate::decode` CONSUMES
///     the D3D12 magic by design, so a packet resubmitted out of the same buffer
///     falls back to the prefix on purpose — a `D12Rec` with no `D12Exact`, and
///     the fail-safe direction the consume exists for.
///  4. **`GpuFncClamp` / `GpuFncGen` ARE ADAPTER-GLOBAL.** Both are decided in
///     `wddm_boundary::select` BEFORE the `d3d12` bit is read, so DWM's D3D11
///     present BLT marker moves them. Subtracting them from a D3D12 accounting
///     mixes populations; their own docs in `virtio/counters.rs` say so.
///  (5. `D12Clr` post-dates the expression and is a further term.)
///
/// ⇒ GRADING, in the forms that ARE true:
///
///  * **SOUND BOUND: `D12Exact <= D12Rec - D12Zero`.** Every exact submission
///    consumes one `'HD12'` record whose surviving `gpu_fence_id` is nonzero, and
///    only a nonzero-fence Render can put one there (`mark_d3d12` takes the max,
///    and a zero-fence record is overwritten rather than merged). A VIOLATION is a
///    real defect — a record honoured twice, or a boundary from somewhere
///    `mark_d3d12` did not write. Every term above slackens this bound in the same
///    direction, which is why it survives all of them.
///  * **THE A4 REGRESSION SIGNAL is qualitative: `D12Rec > D12Zero` while
///    `D12Exact == 0`.** Records named real boundaries and NOT ONE reached
///    SubmitCommand as an exact wait. That is A4 coming back, or the record never
///    surviving to SubmitCommand at all — and unlike a shortfall it needs no
///    arithmetic to state.
///  * **HEALTHY = `D12Exact` MOVES**, at roughly the rate of `ExecuteCommandLists`
///    batches that named a fence, and well below `D12Rec`.
///  * ⛔ **A SHORTFALL AGAINST ANY EXPRESSION ATTRIBUTES NOTHING.** At least five
///    independent terms sit between the two counters, four legitimately nonzero
///    and two adapter-global. If the per-term attribution is ever needed it has to
///    be counted at the site, not inferred here.
///
/// ⚠ The old rule's second half — *"`D12Exact > 0` with `EscSubRing == 0` means
/// the ICD is handing the UMD ring-0 fence ids"* — rests on a reading that cannot
/// occur: `EscSubRing` is adapter-global and DWM's own present path makes it
