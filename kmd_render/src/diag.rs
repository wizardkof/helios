//! dxgkrnl's StartAdapter→AddAdapter sequence drives a series of our DDIs and can

//! to see. To find which DDI dxgkrnl is calling (and which we answer how) right
//! before it gives up, each instrumented PASSIVE-level DDI calls [`record`],
//! which appends a `REG_DWORD` breadcrumb as values `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, … under
//! `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\helios_kmd_render`. After a repro read them in
//! order (`reg query` / `Get-ItemProperty`); the last few before the failure
