# TOOLCHAIN.md — Build Environment Setup

## Canonical build policy — owner directive, 2026-10-04

```text
CANONICAL_BUILD_BACKEND=GITHUB_ACTIONS
LOCAL_VM_ROLE=DEPLOY_AND_RUNTIME_ONLY
LOCAL_PRODUCT_BUILDS=DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT
GITHUB_ACTIONS_USED_FOR_FUTURE_CANDIDATES=YES
PUBLICATION=NO
```

GitHub Actions owns future candidate source qualification, regressions, Release,
Debug, symbols, signing and offline package qualification. WinBoat owns install,
reboot, provisioning, static installation verification and graphical runtime.
Do not build new product candidates, install extra build toolchains or repair the
local VM's build environment without explicit owner authorization. Existing VM
lifecycle authorization still applies to deploy/runtime; it does not authorize
product builds. Historical local builds remain evidence with their original status.

The unreserved CI infrastructure delta was prepared and reviewed in
`.fullstack/work/p06-ci-canonical-20261004`; the reviewed CI delta is applied to the current workspace without a reservation.
Native CI execution is **NOT_RUN**.
Source changes must pass the existing monotonic candidate/source lock before a
future build. No version is allocated just for this infrastructure migration,
and different source must never reuse `.300` or `.303`. Integration prerequisites
remain integration of the qualified DXVK queue/reentry overlay. CMake 3.31.6
was recovered from five hash-matching historical package provenance caches. The workflow refuses absent
regressions and missing producer pins; it does not substitute runner defaults.
See [CI_BUILD_QUALIFICATION.md](docs/CI_BUILD_QUALIFICATION.md) for the contract and
[the implementation report](.fullstack/artifacts/p06/ci-canonical-20261004/REPORT.md)
for current evidence and limits.

Historical `.299` rollback is preserved. `.300` stays frozen and deploy-blocked
by the old installer contract. `.303` keeps Release PASS, Debug PASS, offline
package PASS (69/69) and native packaged schema PASS (8/8); its deploy stays
**PARTIAL** because post-reboot verification is incomplete. Migration does not
promote that result. A separately authorized identical-source reproduction must
be labeled `CI_REPRODUCTION_303`, retain distinct run/artifact identities and
never overwrite the existing `.303` ZIP or receipts.

`BLACK_SCREEN_FIXED`, `DEVICE_LOSS_ORIGIN`, `DEADLOCK_IN_ORIGINAL_CAPTURE`,
`SSH_POST_REBOOT_CAUSE` and `EXTRA_CONTAINER_RESTART_CAUSE` remain **NOT_PROVEN**.

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED (2026-07-05) — install/verify steps are for the abandoned
> System-class driver.** The active driver is the **WDDM render+display miniport**
> (crate `kmd_render`, service/INF `helios_kmd_render`, `helios_kmd_render.cat`),
> a display-class adapter that carries `UserModeDriverName` and owns one VidPn
> source — NOT a System-class device, and it DOES appear
> under Display adapters. The ICD builds as the C **Mesa-Venus** port
> (`vulkan_virtio.dll` via `win_meson`), not a Rust `icd` crate. Use the
> platform build rules and `win_*` MCP tooling in **AGENTS.md** and the deploy
> steps in **HELIOS_DRIVER_DEPLOYMENT.md**; those are authoritative.

> **DIRECTION RESET (2026-06-07):** active KMD work is System-class KMDF + DeviceIoControl + Mesa Venus.
> DOD/dxgk build artifacts may remain as archived reference, but the active build should follow `ARCH.md` and
> `SYSTEM_CLASS_REFOCUS_2026_06_07.md`.

## Overview

You need two environments:
1. **GitHub Actions Windows runner** — builds and qualifies the Windows product.
   **WinBoat Windows 11 guest** — deploy and runtime only.
2. **Linux Host** — builds and runs QEMU + virglrenderer (Venus)

The local Windows build recipes below are historical reference. They do not
authorize compiling future product candidates on WinBoat.

---

## 1. Linux Host Setup

### 1.1 System Requirements

- Linux kernel **6.13+** (required for KVM page-fault fixes with blob resources)
- Vulkan 1.3-capable GPU with a compliant driver (RADV for AMD, ANV for Intel)
- The pinned **`qemu-helios`** submodule (based on QEMU 11.1.1)
- virglrenderer built from source with Venus enabled

Check your kernel:
```bash
uname -r   # must be ≥ 6.13
```

Check Vulkan support:
```bash
vulkaninfo --summary | grep -E "apiVersion|driverVersion"
```

### 1.2 Build the paired virglrenderer and Venus protocol forks

Use the root submodules, not a separately cloned system renderer:

```bash
bash tools/build-native-renderer.sh
```

This builds/tests the protocol and renderer into `target/linux`, synchronizes
Mesa's generated headers and installs the host artifacts into a local prefix.
It does not replace `/usr` or restart QEMU. Python Mako/PyYAML, Meson/Ninja and
Vulkan/DRM/GBM/epoxy development packages are required. The local tools venv
uses Mako1.4.1, MarkupSafe3.0.3 and PyYAML6.0.3 in the recorded build.

The owner selects `tools/qemu-with-native-renderer.sh` through the existing
HELIOS_QEMU_BIN option at their next launcher restart. The wrapper sets the
paired library/render-server paths after sudo has stripped loader variables.
Read [NATIVE_DGC.md](docs/dx12/NATIVE_DGC.md) for exact activation, source/build
versus loaded-artifact verification, and the unresolved host query discrepancy.
Keep the native Windows guest artifacts paired with this protocol build.

### 1.3 Build the pinned QEMU fork

```bash
# Stock QEMU is useful for renderer A/B tests, but it is not the active Windows
# display binary: it cannot reconstruct the modifier-less OPTIMAL DWM primary.
sudo apt install -y \
  libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev libssl-dev \
  libslirp-dev libcap-ng-dev libattr1-dev \
  python3-pip python3-setuptools ninja-build

git submodule update --init --recursive qemu-helios
cd qemu-helios
mkdir -p build-helios && cd build-helios
../configure \
  --target-list=x86_64-softmmu \
  --enable-kvm \
  --enable-opengl \
  --enable-virglrenderer \
  --enable-gtk \
  --enable-sdl \
  --enable-vnc \
  --enable-modules \
  --disable-docs
ninja
```

### 1.4 QEMU Launch Command for Development

**Operational rule:** if you change the standalone VM launch command, launcher script, QEMU display/debug
transport, or any environment variable needed by `tools/launch-helios-gtk.sh`, do not try to start the VM
yourself unless the user explicitly asks in that same turn. Tell the user exactly what changed and ask them to
run the VM. This matters because the launcher often needs the user's desktop session, sudo credentials, GPU
environment, and active display state.

```bash
# egl-headless + VNC (visually verified)
HELIOS_QEMU_RENDER_GPU=nvidia HELIOS_DISPLAY=egl-vnc \
  bash tools/launch-helios-gtk.sh

# Native Wayland SDL is the verified accelerated local-window path. Interactive
# UI EGL follows the compositor's vendor; the launcher pins only Venus/readback
# Vulkan to NVIDIA.
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland \
  HELIOS_QEMU_RENDER_GPU=nvidia HELIOS_DISPLAY=sdl \
  bash tools/launch-helios-gtk.sh

# GTK uses the same fallback code but is not currently operational for a full
# Windows run: GDK later reports repeated eglMakeCurrent failures.
HELIOS_QEMU_RENDER_GPU=nvidia HELIOS_DISPLAY=gtk \
  bash tools/launch-helios-gtk.sh
```

**Key flags explained:**
- `blob=on` — enables blob resource support (zero-copy memory between guest and virglrenderer)
- `hostmem=8G` — dedicates 8 GB of host memory as the blob/hostmem region
- `venus=on` — enables Venus capset (Vulkan over virtio-gpu)
- `-display sdl,gl=on` — verified native-Wayland OpenGL window
- `-display gtk,gl=on` — compiled fallback frontend; currently blocked by the
  GTK/GDK `eglMakeCurrent` failure above

### 1.5 Verify Venus Is Working (Linux Guest First)

Before tackling the Windows driver, verify the stack works end-to-end with a Linux guest:

```bash
# In the Linux guest VM:
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/virtio_icd.x86_64.json
vulkaninfo --summary
vkcube   # should render a spinning cube
```

If this works, your host stack (QEMU + virglrenderer + Venus) is correct.

---

## 2. Windows 11 Dev VM Setup

This is where you compile and test the KMD and ICD.

### 2.0 Dev VM (`win11`)

A Windows 11 dev VM named `win11` is reachable via `ssh win` (preconfigured). It was **not** fully provisioned out of the box — only Rust (stable) was present; everything else below had to be installed. The actually-required, verified toolchain:

- **VS 2022 Build Tools** — "Desktop development with C++" (MSVC v143 + Spectre-mitigated x64 libs).
- **WDK** — kit **10.0.26100.0**. Must be a *complete* kit (SDK **and** WDK at the same version): `wdk-build` picks the **highest** installed kit with **no override**, so an incomplete higher kit (e.g. a winget WDK with no matching SDK → missing `specstrings.h`) breaks the build. Keep only complete kits.
- **LLVM/libclang 22.1.8**, reverified 2026-09-08 at `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`; set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to it. Active KMD and both UMDs require **bindgen 0.72** with layout assertions enabled. The older LLVM17 downgrade advice below has been retired. CI uses the same LLVM version and Vulkan SDK **1.4.350.0**, also reverified in the VM.
- **Rust nightly + `rust-src`** (for `no_std` build-std), target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- **cargo-make** — `cargo install --locked cargo-make`.
- **coreutils** are installed (Unix tools like `ls`/`cp`/`grep` work in `win_exec`).
- **SSH:** `ssh win` does not auto-`cd`; the source tree is at `Z:\`. Prefer the `win` MCP server over raw ssh.
- **Shared folder:** the current Linux project folder (`helios-vgpu/`) is shared into the VM and mounted as the **`Z:\`** drive. `ssh win` does **not** auto-`cd` into it — you must **explicitly `cd /d Z:\`** to reach the shared project folder before running any build commands. Commands run there operate on the same source tree you edit on Linux.

This means a typical Windows-side build must first `cd` into `Z:\`:

```bash
ssh win "cd /d Z:\ && cargo make"   # cd into the shared folder, then build on win11
```

The remaining subsections (§2.1–§2.5) document the full from-scratch setup for reference, but most of it is already done on `win11`.

> **IMPORTANT — building on `win11` (updated):**
> - **Rust IO fails on the `Z:\` share.** `cargo`/`cargo make` hit `OS error 87 (The parameter is incorrect)` on artifact copies and warn `could not canonicalize path Z:\`. So the **Cargo target dir must be on local disk**, not the share. Edit source on `Z:\`; build with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=C:\Users\Rupansh\helios-target\<crate>`.
> - Set it via the **`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` env var** per invocation. Do **NOT** put `target-dir` in a committed `.cargo/config.toml` — Linux reads that file too (it builds shared crates like `protocol/`), and a `C:` path would break it. On Linux use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/linux`.
> - **coreutils are installed** on `win11`: standard Unix tools (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, …) work alongside PowerShell.
> - Prefer the **`win` MCP server** (`win_exec` / `win_cargo`) over raw `ssh win "cd /d Z:\ && …"` — it sidesteps cmd.exe quoting and stale-ControlMaster env, and `win_cargo` sets the local target dir + `LIBCLANG_PATH`.

### 2.1 Required Software

Install in this order:

#### Visual Studio 2022
Download from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/  
Required workloads:
- "Desktop development with C++" (for MSVC toolchain, linker, headers)
- Individual component: "MSVC v143 Spectre-mitigated libs (x64)"

#### Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 22H2
```
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk
```
Install the WDK matching your VS 2022. The WDK installs as a VS extension.

Verify: Open VS → Extensions → should show "Windows Driver Kit".

#### LLVM 22.1.8 and bindgen 0.72
```powershell
winget install -i LLVM.LLVM --version 22.1.8 --force
# Select "Add LLVM to PATH" in the GUI
```

Verify:
```powershell
clang --version  # should print 22.1.8
```

#### Rust (nightly channel — required for no_std kernel mode)
```powershell
# Install rustup from https://rustup.rs/
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
rustup component add rust-src
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

#### cargo-make
```powershell
cargo install --locked cargo-make --no-default-features --features tls-native
```

#### (Optional) cargo-wdk — driver project scaffolding
```powershell
cargo install cargo-wdk
```

### 2.2 Enable Test Signing

The development KMD needs test signing. On the target VM (where the driver runs):

```powershell
# Run as Administrator in the TARGET VM (not necessarily the dev VM)
bcdedit /set testsigning on
bcdedit /set nointegritychecks on
# Reboot
```

On the dev VM, generate a test certificate:
```powershell
# This is done automatically by cargo-make / wdk-build
# The cert goes to: target/<profile>/package/WDRLocalTestCert.cer
# Install it in the target VM's Trusted Root + Trusted Publishers stores
```

### 2.3 Workspace Setup

```powershell
# Create project
mkdir helios-vgpu
cd helios-vgpu

# KMD — kernel-mode driver (KMDF System-class, no_std)
cargo new kmd --lib
cd kmd
```

**`kmd/Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[package]
name = "helios_kmd"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
build = "build.rs"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[package.metadata.wdk.driver-model]
driver-type = "KMDF"
kmdf-version-major = 1
target-kmdf-version-minor = 33
# driver-type = "KMDF" flips the generated INF Class from Display to System
# {4d36e97d-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}.

[dependencies]
wdk = "0.4.0"
wdk-sys = "0.5.0"
wdk-alloc = "0.4.0"
wdk-panic = "0.4.0"

[build-dependencies]
wdk-build = "0.4.0"

[profile.dev]
panic = "abort"
lto = "thin"
opt-level = 1

[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
lto = true
opt-level = 3
codegen-units = 1

[features]
default = []
nightly = ["wdk/nightly", "wdk-sys/nightly"]
```

**`kmd/build.rs`:**
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), wdk_build::ConfigError> {
    wdk_build::Config::from_env_auto()?.configure_binary_build();
    Ok(())
}
```

**`kmd/Cargo.make.toml`:**
```toml
extend = "target/rust-driver-makefile.toml"
[config]
load_script = '''
#!@rust
//! ```cargo
//! [dependencies]
//! wdk-build = "0.4.0"
//! ```
#![allow(unused_doc_comments)]
wdk_build::cargo_make::load_rust_driver_makefile()?
'''
```

**`.cargo/config.toml`:**
```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+crt-static"]

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-msvc]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "target-feature=+crt-static",
    "-Z", "sanitizer=address",   # remove for release
]
```

Build the skeleton:
```powershell
# From the kmd/ directory, in a VS 2022 Developer Command Prompt
cargo make
# Should produce: target/debug/package/helios_kmd.inf + helios_kmd.sys
```

### 2.4 ICD Setup

```powershell
cd ../
cargo new icd --lib
```

**`icd/Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[package]
name = "helios_icd"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]   # produces helios_icd.dll

[dependencies]
# Vulkan bindings
ash = "0.38"              # Vulkan types/enums
# Windows user-mode APIs  
windows = { version = "0.58", features = [
    "Win32_Graphics_Direct3D",
    "Win32_System_Memory",
]}
# Serialization for Venus
bytemuck = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
```

### 2.5 Deploying to the Target VM

Use a network share or WinRM to copy files to the target VM. Then:

```powershell
# On target VM (as Administrator):
pnputil /add-driver helios_kmd.inf /install
# Or using devcon:
devcon install helios_kmd.inf "PCI\VEN_1AF4&DEV_1050"
```

Check Device Manager → the device should appear under "System devices" (System
class {4d36e97d-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}), NOT under "Display adapters". There
is no display adapter and no Code 43 — this is a System-class KMDF function driver,
not a WDDM miniport.

Verify the device interface is reachable from user mode (this is how the ICD finds
the KMD): `SetupDiGetClassDevs(&GUID_DEVINTERFACE_HELIOS, ...)` →
`SetupDiEnumDeviceInterfaces` → `SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail` → `CreateFile` on
the returned device path should succeed.

Check for errors:
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object {$_.ProviderName -eq "helios_kmd"} | Select-Object -First 20
```

---

## 3. Debugging Setup

### WinDbg Kernel Debugging (Host ↔ Target VM)

The same launch-command rule applies to kernel debugging. If adding or changing a KD transport requires a QEMU
argument or `tools/launch-helios-gtk.sh` environment change, document the exact command and
ask the user to run/restart the VM. Configure guest BCD and build tools from automation, but leave VM launch to
the user after launch-command changes.

On the target VM:
```powershell
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings net hostip:192.168.x.x port:50001 key:1.1.1.1
```

On the dev machine, open WinDbg and connect:
```
File → Attach to Kernel → Net → Port: 50001, Key: 1.1.1.1
```

Useful WinDbg commands for KMDF driver debugging:
```
!wdfkd                       # load the WDF debugger extension
!wdfkd.wdfldr                # show loaded WDF drivers / framework versions
!wdfkd.wdfdevice             # inspect our WDFDEVICE (context, queues, interrupts)
lm m helios*                 # check driver is loaded
!devnode 0 1 "PCI\VEN_1AF4"  # find our device node
.reload /f helios_kmd.sys    # load symbols
```

### DbgPrint Viewing (simpler — no kernel debugger needed)

Use [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) from SysInternals in the target VM. It captures `DbgPrint` / `KdPrint` output.

In Rust (via wdk-sys):
```rust
use wdk_sys::ntddk::KdPrint;
// KdPrint is a macro that calls DbgPrint in debug builds
// Usage:
unsafe { KdPrint!("Helios: adapter started\n\0"); }
```

### virglrenderer Logging (Host Side)

> ⚠️ **`VIRGL_DEBUG` does NOT reliably produce readable logs** with the venus render-server:
> venus runs in the `virgl_render_server` child whose stderr may not be captured. See HOST.md
> §5.1. Use QEMU `-d guest_errors` for `RESP_ERR_*`; for venus traces, capture the
> render-server child's stderr directly or build virglrenderer with logging.

## 4. Version Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Linux kernel | 6.13 | Latest stable | Blob resource KVM fixes |
| QEMU | 9.2.0 | Latest | Venus upstreamed in 9.2 |
| virglrenderer | 1.1.0 | Latest | Build from source with -Dvenus=true |
| Mesa (Linux guest test) | 24.2 | Latest | Venus ICD |
| WDK | 10.0.26100.0 | 10.0.26100.0 | For KMDF/WDF (KMDF 1.33) |
| VS | 2022 | 2022 | Earlier versions may work |
| LLVM/libclang | 22.1.8 pinned | 22.1.8 | Match CI and bindgen0.72; keep layout assertions |
| Rust | nightly-2024-11+ | Latest nightly | 2024 edition |
| windows-drivers-rs | 0.4.x / 0.5.x | Latest | wdk = 0.4, wdk-sys = 0.5 |

---

## 5. Common Build Failures

### "cannot find -lntoskrnl"
The WDK is not on PATH or VS Developer Command Prompt was not used.  
Fix: Build inside "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022".

### bindgen fails with LLVM error
Verify `LIBCLANG_PATH` resolves LLVM22.1.8 and every bindgen dependency is0.72.
Older bindgen versions can emit one-byte forward-declaration layouts under
libclang22. Do not disable layout assertions or downgrade bindgen; see AGENTS.md
for the matching `wdk-build` git pin requirement.

### KMD loads but crashes on start
Check IRQL. A common mistake is calling pageable functions at DISPATCH_LEVEL during virtqueue init. Use `KeGetCurrentIrql()` assertions in debug.
